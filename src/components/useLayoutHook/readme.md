### use layout effect hook

it is used for dom manipulation.
it is called before the print function has done its execution.
useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after all DOM mutations, while useEffect runs asynchronously after the browser has painted the screen.

useLayoutEffect can be used when you need to make changes to the DOM and immediately read the updated layout. For example, you might use useLayoutEffect to measure the size of an element after it has been rendered.

Here are some important points to keep in mind when using useLayoutEffect:

Synchronous execution: As mentioned above, useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. This means that it can be used to make changes to the DOM and immediately read the updated layout, but it can also cause performance issues if not used carefully.
Component lifecycle: useLayoutEffect runs during the "commit" phase of the React component lifecycle, after the component has been rendered but before the browser has painted the screen. This is in contrast to useEffect, which runs after the browser has painted the screen.
Cancellation: Like useEffect, useLayoutEffect can be cancelled by returning a function from the hook. This function will be called before the next render, allowing you to clean up any side effects.
Performance: Because useLayoutEffect runs synchronously, it can be more expensive than useEffect. It's important to use useLayoutEffect sparingly and only when it's necessary to read the updated layout immediately after making changes to the DOM.
