use state is used for storing the current state of your application. The state object contains data that may change over time, and any component connected to this state will re-render whenever the state changes.

In React Redux, the global state is stored in a single object called `state`.

## Blackbox on useState Hook

The useState hook is a built-in function in React that allows functional components to have state. It was introduced in React 16.8 and has since become a popular way to manage state in React applications.

The useState hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.

The useState hook can be called multiple times in the same component to manage multiple state variables.
