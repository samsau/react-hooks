The useRef hook is used when we want to customize a particular element in a React component.
The useRef hook is loaded after the page is loaded, which means it can be used to access and manipulate DOM elements that have already been rendered.
The useRef hook returns a mutable ref object that persists across multiple renders, allowing us to maintain a reference to a particular element or value throughout the lifetime of a component.
The useRef hook can be particularly useful when working with animations, scrolling effects, or other interactive features that require access to specific DOM elements.
